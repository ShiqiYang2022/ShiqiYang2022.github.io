## Independent Research  (Draft avaliable upon request)
### The Welfare Effect of Online Video Advertisement  
Last updated: 12/2024

Online video platforms have seen a sharp rise in advertising revenues, yet little is known about the impact of advertisements on viewership welfare. This paper investigates the welfare effects of native advertisements on _Bilibili_, China‚Äôs largest video-sharing platform with over 341 million active users. Using a scraped time series dataset of _Bilibili_ video viewership, advertisement information and engagement metrics, I estimate a three-stage equilibrium model incorporating consumers, video creators, and the platform to evaluate the welfare effects. Descriptive results show that native ads have small and insignificant negative effects on viewership. Native advertising tends to be more beneficial to viewers, measured by engagement metrics, in video markets that appeal more to younger audiences and feature greater product differentiation.  

### Pricing and Welfare Effect of Platform Strategies  
Last updated: 12/2024

We study the impact of multi-sided platform strategies in pricing and welfare. Platforms in different markets adopt distinct competitive strategies, resulting in varying markups. We develop a symmetric model in which user preferences include heterogeneous participation benefits and homogeneous cross-side externalities. Within this model, we analyze three distinct strategies: Cournot, Bertrand, and Insulated Tariff, and derive the respective analytical equilibrium pricing formulas associated with each approach. Using numerical examples, we also find that the presence of externalities can reverse the standard effect of competition.


### Does Credit Support Policy Lead to Misallocation? _(Joint with Chun Zhao)_  
Last updated: 10/2022

This paper studies credit allocation across firms and its industrial effect under China‚Äôs credit support policy for small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Using both loan-level data and financial data from all 15,000 firms on National Equities Exchange and Quotations (2015-2019), we found: (1) Financial constraints of SMEs were falling, while those of medium-sized firms were rising. (2) There is an interest rate gap at the small-medium cut-off line, where the interest rate of medium-sized firms is disproportionately higher, which appeared in 2015 and gradually expanded. We rationalize these facts into a static equilibrium model with information asymmetry where banks can not observe productivity (TFP) precisely and demonstrate that credit support policies may increase industrial concentration and lead to lower aggregate output.


### Faster Growth after Getting Rid of Poverty  
Last updated: 12/2021

This paper evaluates the impact of the poverty exit mechanism on the economic growth of the registered national poor counties in China's poverty alleviation program. The exit decision (deregistration) is primarily based on whether a county's Poverty Incidence Rate falls below a given poverty line. Applying Regression Discontinuity, we identified the causal effect that the exit decision increased the county GDP by about 1.8% per year.
